#+TITLE: 7TV Emotes on YouTube Comments

Yeah, but userscripts are like a third party thing and... I don't know...

 * +Enables 7TV global emotes on every channel (can manually disable in script)+
 * Enables 7TV channel emotes on comments sections of YouTube channels that are linked on 7TV

* Installation

Build with ~make~ (requires ~typescript~) or [[https://humanoidsandvichdispenser.github.io/youtube-comments-7tv/script.user.js][install from here]].

Note that this script uses the GreaseMonkey API for various functions, so your userscript manager must support it.

* Todo List
** DONE Replace ~void scanComments~ with a ~MutationObserver~
** DONE Global emotes
** DONE Cache emote data
** TODO Refresh emotes when window href changes
** TODO Insert image elements programatically instead of modifying ~innerHTML~
** DONE Configuration options
*** DONE Enable/disable global emotes on non-7TV channels
*** DONE Emote cache time-to-live
